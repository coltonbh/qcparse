# Design Decisions

## Other parse packages to look at

- [iodata](https://github.com/theochem/iodata) and [cclib](https://cclib.github.io/contents.html) are recommended by [this](https://mattermodeling.stackexchange.com/questions/6532/whats-the-best-quantum-chemistry-output-parser-for-the-command-line) StackOverflow post. `iodata` was [published](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.26468?casa_token=iQFOBtKf0qAAAAAA:pAv_vxn6Nfis_DhQENlqGpeIZoawNhJYCg17fdobB3ftuyEbHSOAyHbsjKTeU_AdVS48EiqqQDzUHKNf) in 2020 so I'd consider it the more modern alternative. It's still a mess to use.
